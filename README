To Do:

o Make import statements and relative paths just work
   - restructure into standard Python package structure to do relative imports.
- Extend S2SimSession and the messages to reflect the new interoperability doc
- Write a sample negotiation/forecast client? Will need for testing anyway.
- Robustification of S2SimSession connection to timeouts
- Document S2SimSession API in README
